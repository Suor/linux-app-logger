# Active app/window logger for linux

Just a tiny python script for quantified self purporses.


## INSTALL

1. Clone repo.
2. Install wmctrl and python-daemon.
3. Adjust paths in ll script.
4. Add it to Startup Applications (for Ubuntu)

By default you'll get logged active app name and active window title every minute. It's up to you what to do with that data ;)
